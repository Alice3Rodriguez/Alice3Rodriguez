## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m an Android developer passionate about building high-quality mobile applications using Kotlin and clean architecture principles. My focus is on creating maintainable, testable, and scalable apps that deliver smooth, intuitive user experiences while staying robust under the hood.

I follow clean architecture to separate concerns clearly across layersâ€”presentation, domain, and dataâ€”ensuring that the codebase remains modular and adaptable as features evolve. This approach helps me build apps that are easier to test, extend, and debug, especially as projects grow in complexity. Whether Iâ€™m working on new feature development or refactoring legacy code, maintainability and clarity are always priorities.

Kotlin is my language of choice for Android development. Its concise syntax, null safety, and functional features make it ideal for writing expressive, reliable code. I also use modern Android development tools and practices like Jetpack libraries, Coroutines, Flow, Hilt for dependency injection, and Room for local persistence. My projects typically follow MVVM architecture at the presentation layer and are designed with SOLID principles in mind.

This repository contains a collection of my Android projectsâ€”ranging from small prototypes to more complete applicationsâ€”all built with clean architecture and modern development practices. Some explore specific patterns or libraries, while others demonstrate full app workflows, including networking, caching, and offline support.

If you're an Android developer, Kotlin enthusiast, or someone interested in clean architecture and scalable mobile design, feel free to explore the code, open issues, or contribute. I'm always looking to collaborate, share ideas, and improve through community feedback.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and happy coding!
